# Crop-Recommendation-System-
In this project, I developed a machine learning system that analyzes soil, climate, and environmental data to provide optimal crop recommendations. This project is designed to help farmers make informed decisions, ultimately improving crop yield and reducing farming costs.

Key Features:
Collected and preprocessed data from Kaggle using Pandas.
Implemented models such as Random Forest, Decition Tree and Xgboost etc.. with Scikit-Learn.
Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated models with cross-validation

Tools:
Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Pandas
