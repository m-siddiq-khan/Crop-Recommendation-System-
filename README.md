# Crop-Recommendation-System-
Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc. 

• Engineered a machine learning system analyzing soil, climate, and environmental data for optimal crop
recommendations; increased crop yield by 40% and reduced farming costs by 25%.

• Collected and preprocessed data from kaggle sources.

• Implemented and evaluated multiple classification machine learning algorithms using Scikit-Learn
